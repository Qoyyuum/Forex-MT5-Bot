This is a study on how different Neural Networks would be able to find the right way of modelling and finding a pattern through limited past or backtests before attempting to place a trade.

Develop in Python 🐍 with all of the packages mentioned in the `requirements.txt`. Primarily using Pytorch to model a Neural Network.
